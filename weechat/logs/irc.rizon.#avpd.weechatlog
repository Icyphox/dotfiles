2018-01-19 22:17:59	Sylisia	[16:17:37] How are you gonna heat the old screen?
2018-01-19 22:17:59	ogleman	[16:18:08] my dad heated it with a hairdrier! he already replaced the screen :D
2018-01-19 22:17:59	ogleman	[16:18:17] he's done it once before so
2018-01-19 22:17:59	Sylisia	[16:18:26] Yeah i wad gonna suggest a hair dryer too
2018-01-19 22:17:59	Laume	[16:18:48] device dependant 2FA that can't be moved or disabled if device breaks :o

2018-01-19 22:17:59	ogleman	[16:19:35] I could remove it laume but that's a pain that i didn't want to do lol. and the 2FA codes were not so important that I needed them immidiatly
2018-01-19 22:17:59	Laume	[16:19:49] okey
2018-01-19 22:17:59	Sylisia	[16:19:51] I fixed an iPhone 5s for visages coworker last weekend
2018-01-19 22:17:59	Sylisia	[16:20:30] So you spend like 80 euros to replace the screen instead lol?
2018-01-19 22:17:59	ogleman	[16:20:44] oh nice! my dad likes to fiddle with electronics. always has :D he's an electrical engineer by schooling
2018-01-19 22:17:59	+bobross	[16:20:47] They say iPhones are bitch to repair
2018-01-19 22:17:59	ogleman	[16:21:18] my dad bought a screen from that chinese site. was 20 euros total I think

2018-01-19 22:17:59	ogleman	[16:23:43] ei ole kukaan niin viisas kuin insinööri, paitsi diplomi insinööri -- something my dad loves to say >.>
